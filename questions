how to show in art.erb characteristics only if they exist

why is my layout only applying to my index page?
-because I needed the / --it knew public was where stylesheets were

why are my migrations failing
-typo

do I have to write tests for migrations
-probably not, we write an up and a down migration so add the changes, and then down brings it back to original

why is the browser still trying to render commented out html?
	-can't comment in erb because combo of html and ruby--otherwise you wouldn't be able to template




characteristics of art pieces
name, artists, medium, dimensions, edition (left justified)

"the bid" (price) (right justified)

people can enter higher prices, and it automatically adjusts if the bid price is higher; have to put in payment info when they bid (login to venmo?)

people will type in an id, and then it will pull up this information

fonts: rubik and ribik mono one; din condensed and din condensed bold

loading icon should be spinning dino; favicon should be dino
